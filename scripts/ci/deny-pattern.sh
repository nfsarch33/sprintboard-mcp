# v18750-O-Track-D: deny-pattern anti-leak scanner
#
# Scans git diff (against base ref) for forbidden patterns: 1Password vault
# names, internal IPs, PII keys, API tokens, security keys, etc.
#
# v18794 — the allow-file header on line 2 is for a DIFFERENT gate, and it has
# to stay on line 2. helixon-platform's .github/scripts/public-repo-gate.sh
# greps its tree for the literal `ssh-rsa ` under the category `private_key`,
# and the PATTERNS array below carries that literal as a REGEX DESCRIBING the
# format -- there is no key material in this file. So the first commit that
# installed this scanner into helixon-platform failed that repo's gate on the
# artefact it was adding, which is the same shape as the self-match v18792
# fixed, one scanner's pattern list tripping another scanner.
#
# The annotation is the mechanism that gate documents and that twelve files in
# helixon-platform already use; the alternative was splitting the literal to
# dodge a grep, which is obfuscation and would leave the pattern less readable
# than the thing it detects. It must appear within the first
# PUBLIC_REPO_GATE_HEADER_LINES (default 5) lines or it is not consulted --
# tools/deny-pattern-tests.sh pins both the header and that line budget.
#
# Usage:
#   bash deny-pattern.sh [BASE_REF]
#     BASE_REF defaults to origin/main (or HEAD~1 if no origin)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — nothing to scan, no matches, or this IS the internal repo
#   1 — at least one match found (fail the workflow / pre-push)
#   2 — configuration error (missing base, git failure)
#
# This script is the canonical scanner; it's invoked by:
#   - .github/workflows/deny-pattern.yml (PR check, no GH Actions minutes)
#   - .git/hooks/pre-push (local pre-push, instant feedback)
#   - L0 rule 01-public-repo-sanity.mdc (AI agent auto-check before commit)
#
# v18790 — two defects fixed. Both made this gate report something other than
# what it had actually done, and both reproduced on pristine main @659deaa9d.
#
#   1. INTERNAL_REPO was decided by a GLOB OVER THE WORKING-DIRECTORY PATH:
#        case "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" in *cursor-global-kb*)
#      so ANY repo checked out beneath a directory whose name contains
#      "cursor-global-kb" bypassed every deny pattern — vault names, Tailscale
#      IPs, PATs, Slack tokens, operator emails — and a legitimate KB worktree
#      at a path that did not carry the name failed to bypass. Repo identity
#      now comes from the repo: the origin remote's owner/repo slug, with a
#      tracked marker file as the fallback. The checkout path decides nothing.
#
#   2. `DIFF=$(... | grep -E '^\+' | grep -v '^+++')` died under
#      `set -o pipefail` whenever the diff added no lines — grep exits 1 — so
#      the script exited 1 having printed one line and scanned nothing, and
#      the "No diff to scan" branch below it was unreachable. Every caller
#      read that as "anti-leak scan FAILED". The empty case now says so and
#      exits 0; a base ref that does not resolve is a genuine configuration
#      error and exits 2, so the fail-closed direction is kept where it belongs.
#
# v18791 — the third of the same family, left out of scope by #875 and fixed
# here. `FOUND` was a 0/1 flag that the summary printed as if it were a count:
#
#     FOUND=1                                    # in the per-pattern loop
#     echo "FAIL: $FOUND pattern match(es) ..."  # in the summary
#
# so a run that had just printed four MATCH blocks — a vault name, an op://
# reference, a Tailscale IP and an operator email — still signed off with
# "FAIL: 1 pattern match(es)". Reproduced on pristine main @4f0aa9a7b. The
# blocks were right and only the summary was wrong, but the summary is the
# line that gets quoted into a PR comment, a hook failure and a runbook, so
# the gate consistently understated what it had found. It is a real counter
# now, and each block reports its own line count and says when the three-line
# cap hid some.
#
# v18792 — the fourth, and the reason the installer had never been run. Seven
# PATTERNS entries were plain literal strings, because that is what a pattern
# list is, so the commit that ADDS this file to a public repo matched seven of
# its own patterns — reproduced on pristine main @4f0aa9a7b: 7 MATCH blocks,
# exit 1. (The seven are no longer named here: see v18793 below — this file is
# installed into public repositories, and an enumeration of them is exactly
# the thing that must not travel.) The pull
# request that installs the gate went red on the artefact it was adding, and
# the installed pre-push hook blocked the very push that installs it. The only
# way past was --no-verify, which L0 rule 01-public-repo-sanity.mdc forbids and
# should, so scripts/ci/install-deny-pattern.sh could never be run against
# helixon-platform or llm-cluster-router — the two public repos, and the entire
# point of the installer. This scanner's own source is now excluded from the
# diff it reads; see SELF_PATH below for the shape of that exclusion and
# docs/security/anti-leak.md for what still covers the excluded file.
#
# v18793 — the fifth, and the one that had to land before the installer was
# ever pointed at a public repository. This file's PATTERNS array IS a list of
# the identifiers that name this estate: a 1Password vault name, an SA token
# name, two operator email addresses, an internal host-naming scheme, an agent
# name. Installing the gate into a public repo published that list — a curated,
# machine-readable index of exactly what an attacker should grep the estate's
# public artefacts for. Measured 2026-08-31 against origin/main: for
# llm-cluster-router seven of them, including BOTH operator email addresses,
# would have been NEW disclosure.
#
# So the patterns are now in two sets:
#
#   PUBLIC   — vendor credential FORMATS (AWS, GitHub, Slack, Stripe, SSH keys)
#              and the generic private-address ranges. None of these names this
#              estate; they are safe in a public tree, and they are the ones a
#              real credential leak trips.
#   INTERNAL — everything that identifies this estate. Kept OUT of this file
#              and loaded at runtime from HLXN_DENY_PATTERNS_FILE, which points
#              at a file that only ever exists where it is already private: the
#              knowledge base checkout (for the local pre-push hook) or an
#              Actions secret materialised on the runner (for CI).
#
# The run always says which sets it loaded. An unset HLXN_DENY_PATTERNS_FILE is
# a legitimate, announced reduction in coverage; a SET-but-unreadable one is a
# configuration error and exits 2, because "the internal set was configured and
# silently did not load" must never look like "the internal set is not
# configured".
#
# INTERNAL_SLUG below stays a literal on purpose. The owner handle appears in
# every clone URL of these repos and `cursor-global-kb` is already in 70 files
# of helixon-platform and 10 of llm-cluster-router (measured 2026-08-31), so it
# discloses nothing new — and hashing it would rewrite the exemption logic
# v18790 fixed and that tools/deny-pattern-tests.sh pins in both directions.
#
# v18797 — the sixth. The operator GitHub handle is an internal deny pattern,
# and the handle is ALSO the owner segment of every one of these repos' OWN
# module paths (github.com/nfsarch33/<this-repo>), which sit on go.mod and on
# every internal import. So a diff that added a new internal import tripped the
# handle pattern on a string the repo is public by construction for carrying —
# llm-cluster-router PR #73, and every future PR to either public repo that
# adds an internal import. The scanner now removes exactly that one public slug
# (this repo's own github.com/<owner>/<repo>, at a path boundary) from the added
# lines before matching; a reference to any OTHER repo under the same handle,
# including a private one, is untouched and still caught. See the SCAN_DIFF
# block below and docs/security/anti-leak.md.
#
# v18811 — the seventh, and the only one this file caused itself. v18797 above
# matched EVERY pattern against the shortened lines, so any pattern whose match
# had to run past the slug went silent: an SSH public key whose comment ended
# at the repo's own module path passed the gate, in both public repos, with the
# public set alone. The removal is now applied per pattern — only to a pattern
# the module path would itself match — and leaves a separator behind. See the
# v18811 note in the SCAN_DIFF block below.
#
# v18813 - the eighth, and the first that was never about the patterns at all.
# The filter that separates added lines from diff headers was TEXTUAL:
#
#     DIFF="$(... | grep -E '^\+' | grep -v '^+++' || true)"
#
# git prefixes an added line with ONE `+`, so file content beginning with TWO
# `+` produces a diff line beginning `+++` -- indistinguishable, to that filter,
# from the `+++ b/<path>` header it exists to drop. The line was discarded
# UNSCANNED, anywhere in any file, because nothing anchored the filter to the
# region where a header can occur. Measured 2026-09-05 against origin/main
# @f036ca83 with the PUBLIC set alone, same payload line, varying only the
# leading characters of the file content:
#
#     leader ''    -> exit 1  caught
#     leader '+'   -> exit 1  caught
#     leader '++'  -> exit 0  BYPASSED
#     leader '+++' -> exit 0  BYPASSED
#
# The carrier is ordinary rather than contrived. A patch that edits a patch has
# its own added lines prefixed twice; the combined diff `git show` prints for a
# merge commit marks an added line with two columns. Commit either artefact --
# an evidence directory is full of them -- and every one of its `++` lines
# reaches the outer diff as `+++` and is dropped. A patch adding an SSH key, an
# AWS key ID or an internal address passed the gate.
#
# The header is now dropped STRUCTURALLY, by hunk boundary; see the v18813 note
# at the DIFF extraction below for why the one-line textual narrowing was
# measured and rejected.
#
# v18814 — the ninth, and the widest of the family: the gate never looked at
# an added file that git classed as BINARY, and said so as a clean pass.
#
# `git diff` renders such a file as one line — `Binary files /dev/null and
# b/<path> differ` — and NO content lines at all, so the extractor above found
# nothing, the empty-diff branch fired, and the run printed
#
#     OK: no added lines in diff against <ref> - nothing to scan (empty range,
#     or only scripts/ci/deny-pattern.sh changed)
#
# and exited 0. Not one pattern in either set ran, against a file whose bytes
# were going into a public repository verbatim. Reproduced 2026-09-05 against
# pristine origin/main, with the PUBLIC set alone, so it needed no secret and
# no estate identifier:
#
#   a file whose first byte is NUL, carrying `<rsa-key-format> <blob> user@host`
#     -> exit 0, "no added lines"
#   the identical payload in a .txt -> exit 1, MATCH [SSH RSA public key]
#
# Nothing about that is exotic. Git calls a blob binary on ANY of:
#
#   * a NUL byte anywhere in the first 8k — every archive, image, database,
#     compiled object, and any text file that picked one up;
#   * a `-diff` or `binary` attribute in a COMMITTED .gitattributes — which is
#     content a pull request can add, so the bypass was reachable BY THE DIFF
#     BEING SCANNED;
#   * a blob over core.bigFileThreshold.
#
# A fourth rendering hid content just as completely: a `diff=<driver>` textconv
# rewriting the added lines before the gate saw them. (A fifth, an external
# diff driver, was closed by v18813's --no-ext-diff just above; it is the one
# that leaves no "Binary files" line behind at all, so it had no tell.)
#
# So the diff options are now a single list used by BOTH invocations:
#
#   --text          render every blob as text, whatever the heuristic, the
#                   attribute or the size say.
#   --no-textconv   ignore a configured textconv driver; the gate reads what is
#                   committed, never a rendering of it.
#   --no-ext-diff   from v18813, kept here so one list is the whole answer.
#
# THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN, and the half that was missing looked exactly
# like the half that was fixed. Once binary content reaches the added lines it
# carries invalid UTF-8, and GNU grep treats input with encoding errors as
# binary and stops printing matching lines — writing its notice to stderr since
# 3.5, so the caller sees an empty result and NO diagnostic. Measured on grep
# 3.11 under LANG=C.UTF-8, eight invalid bytes ahead of a verbatim public key
# were enough to take `grep -niE` from one match to zero. Hence LC_ALL=C below,
# and `-a` at the point of use. (v18813's awk extractor is unaffected: gawk
# 5.2.1 was measured on the same input and reads it correctly either way.)
#
# The trade-off is deliberate and in the documented direction (see "Responding
# to a finding" in docs/security/anti-leak.md): genuine binary assets are now
# scanned as text, so a byte sequence inside a PNG or a tarball can trip a
# pattern. That is a false positive, and false positives are cheap here; the
# thing it replaces is a permanent, silent false negative on every opaque file
# ever added. Measured over every tracked binary blob in both public repos
# before landing — 0 of 0 and 0 of 1 tripping — see docs/security/anti-leak.md.
#
# v18814 (the path half) — the added file's PATH is never scanned, and every
# version above shares it, the binary fix included. The extraction is
# hunk-scoped, so `+++ b/<path>` is skipped — and it is the ONLY line in a
# unified diff that carries a new file's name. The other path-bearing lines
# (`diff --git`, `new file mode`, `rename to`) sit outside the hunks too. So a
# deny pattern present only in a file or directory NAME was invisible to every
# pattern in both sets.
#
# This estate names evidence directories after the host they were captured on,
# so the internal host-naming patterns are precisely the ones a path carries;
# helixon-platform, a PUBLIC repo, already tracks 28 such paths. A pure rename
# was sharper still: it adds no lines at all, so the run took the "nothing to
# scan" branch and exited 0 having loaded no patterns.
#
# The header is still not scanned as a diff line — the extraction is untouched.
# The range's added and renamed PATHS are enumerated SEPARATELY, so a path is
# scanned because it was asked for rather than as a side effect. See the
# v18814 path block below the extraction for the --diff-filter=ACR reasoning.
#
# Regression pins: tools/deny-pattern-tests.sh (registered in
# tools/workspace-doctor.sh). The installer that ships this scanner into other
# repos is pinned by tools/install-deny-pattern-tests.sh.

set -euo pipefail

# v18814 — every regex in this file matches BYTES, not characters.
#
# Once --text renders opaque blobs (see the v18814 note above), the added lines
# carry arbitrary bytes, and in a UTF-8 locale those are ENCODING ERRORS. GNU
# grep treats such input as binary and stops printing matching lines, writing
# its notice to stderr, so a caller sees an empty result and no diagnostic --
# which is the same false negative this file keeps rediscovering, wearing the
# same clothes. C is also simply the right locale for a leak gate: byte-oriented
# matching cannot be steered by how a file happens to be encoded, and the

#     glob, never a directory, never read from the environment, an argument, or
#     the diff being scanned. A gate whose exempt paths can be named by the
#     diff it is scanning is not a gate.
#   * `top,` anchors the pathspec to the repository ROOT. Without it a pathspec
#     resolves against the CURRENT DIRECTORY, and the pre-push hook runs
#     wherever the operator happened to type `git push`. Measured 2026-08-31
#     from scripts/ci/: a bare ':(exclude)scripts/ci/deny-pattern.sh' excludes

# v18814 — the tripwire on the guarantee those options provide.
#
# With --text, git does not take the binary branch in builtin_diff() and so
# cannot emit this line; every rendering measured for v18814 confirms that.
# This is therefore an ASSERTION, not a live code path, and it is here because
# of how this file travels: scripts/ci/install-deny-pattern.sh COPIES it into
# public repositories, where the copy can be hand-edited, reverted, or left
# behind by a newer upstream. If any of that drops an option, the failure mode
# is the ORIGINAL defect -- a whole file unscanned, reported as a clean pass --
# which is precisely the shape that survives review. So the invariant is
# checked rather than assumed, and a violation is exit 2: nothing was scanned
# for that path, and "we could not look" must never leave by the same door as
# "we looked and it was clean".
#
# `^`-anchored: an added line carrying this text is prefixed with `+` by git and
# a context line with a space, so only git's own unprefixed rendering matches.
#
# The `and b/<path>` half of the anchor is load-bearing too, and it is why this
# does not simply grep for "Binary files". Measured 2026-09-05, the three
# renderings git produces are:
#
#   added     Binary files /dev/null and b/<path> differ    -> captured
#   modified  Binary files a/<path>  and b/<path> differ    -> captured
#   DELETED   Binary files a/<path>  and /dev/null differ   -> NOT captured
#

# v18813 - drop the diff headers STRUCTURALLY, not by prefix.
#
# The old filter was `grep -E '^\+' | grep -v '^+++'`, and its second stage
# could not tell a header from content: git prefixes an added line with one
# `+`, so content beginning `++` arrives as `+++` and was removed with the real
# `+++ b/<path>` header. See the v18813 note in this file's header for the
# measurement and the carrier.
#
# The narrow textual fix -- `grep -vE '^\+\+\+ (a|b)/'` -- was written,
# measured and REJECTED. It moves the collision instead of removing it:
# content beginning `++ b/` still arrives as `+++ b/` and is still eaten
# (measured 2026-09-05: baseline exit 0, narrowed filter exit 0, the parse
# below exit 1), and the `a/`,`b/` anchor is not a property of the format --
# `diff.noprefix`, `--no-prefix` and `--src-prefix`/`--dst-prefix` all retire
# it, at which point the narrowed filter stops dropping the header and starts
# scanning every file PATH in the tree instead. A gate whose correctness
# depends on file content never resembling a header is the defect, not the fix.
#
# So the boundary is taken from the format's own structure. An added line
# exists only inside a hunk, and every header line of a file section precedes
# that section's first `@@`:
#
#   * `diff --git ` at column 0 opens a file section and closes any open hunk.
#     Inside a hunk that text is `+diff --git `, `-diff --git ` or
#     ` diff --git `, so the unprefixed form cannot occur there.
#   * `@@` at column 0 opens a hunk. Inside a hunk every line carries an
#     indicator (` `, `+`, `-`, `\`), so an added line whose content starts
#     `@@` is `+@@` and cannot be mistaken for a hunk header either.
#   * Everything else is scanned iff it is inside a hunk and starts with `+`.
#     `+++ b/<path>` never is: it sits between `diff --git` and the first `@@`.
#
# This is a strict SUPERSET of what the old filter kept -- no header line
# begins with `+` except `+++`, which the hunk boundary excludes on its own --
# so the change can only ever add lines to the scan. It is also prefix-blind,
# which the alternative above is not. The other direction is pinned too: a file
# PATH is still never scanned HERE, because turning this false negative into a
# false positive on every path in the tree would be its own defect. Since
# v18814 the paths a range INTRODUCES are scanned - but from their own
# enumeration below, never by relaxing this boundary, and never for a path that
# was merely modified.
#
# The `|| true` is gone with the greps that needed it. awk exits 0 on empty
# input, so the v18790 empty-range behaviour below is now structural rather
# than a suppressed exit code -- and an awk that cannot run is a configuration
# error (exit 2) rather than an empty DIFF that reads as a clean scan.

# v18814 (path half) - the added file's PATH is content too, and it was never
# scanned.
#
# The extraction above is hunk-scoped, so every diff header is skipped -
# including `+++ b/<path>`, the ONLY line in a unified diff carrying a new
# file's name. The other lines that name a path (`diff --git a/... b/...`,
# `new file mode`, `rename to <path>`) sit outside the hunks as well. That is
# correct for reading CONTENT and is left exactly as written; it is also why a
# deny pattern appearing only in a file or directory NAME was invisible to
# every pattern in both sets.
#
# Not a corner case here: this estate names evidence directories after the host
# they were captured on, so the internal host-naming patterns are exactly the
# ones a path carries. Reproduced 2026-09-05 against origin/main with the
# internal set loaded - a file added at an evidence path carrying a host name,
# whose CONTENT is innocuous, exited 0 "OK: no deny-pattern matches", while the
# same host name in the file BODY exited 1. A pure rename was sharper still: it
# adds no lines, so the run took the empty branch below and exited 0 having
# loaded no patterns and scanned nothing at all.
#
# So the paths are enumerated SEPARATELY and folded in as synthetic lines. The
# header stays unscanned and the hunk boundary is untouched: a path is scanned
# because it was asked for, not as a side effect of the extraction. The prefix
# keeps a path visibly distinct from a content line in a MATCH block and cannot
# break a pattern - no pattern in either set is anchored (none contains ^ or
# $), and an added content line already carries a leading `+`, so a
# start-of-line anchor could never have worked here anyway.
#
# --diff-filter=ACR - Added, Copied, Renamed-to. Deliberately NOT M:
#
#   * A path that already exists on the base ref is not new disclosure. That is
#     the same reasoning the removed-lines rule above rests on: this gate scans
#     what a range INTRODUCES. It is also what keeps the fix deployable -
#     helixon-platform tracks 28 paths carrying an internal host name (measured
#     2026-09-05 on origin/main, 780 files). With M included, every PR that
#     merely edited one of them would fail on a name it did not choose and
#     could not fix. Over that repo's last 120 commits: 7 would go red under
#     ACR - each one the commit that ADDED such a path, which is the case this
#     exists to catch - against 14 under ACMR. It is also the policy the
#     v18813b path control in tools/deny-pattern-tests.sh defers to: that
#     control pins the EXTRACTION on a modified path, which is outside this
#     filter either way, so the two hold simultaneously.
#   * R reports only the DESTINATION path, so renaming AWAY from a bad name is
#     never flagged: the cleanup commit is not blocked by the gate that asked
#     for it.
#   * If rename detection is off, a rename is reported as A plus D instead, and
#     the A still carries the destination. Either way the new name is scanned.
#
# The range form is RANGE_MODE, the one the content diff actually used, and the

# v18797 — neutralize the repo's OWN public module path before matching.
#
# The operator GitHub handle is an internal deny pattern, but that handle is
# ALSO the owner segment of every one of these repos' own module paths:
# `github.com/nfsarch33/<this-repo>`. That path sits on go.mod's `module` line,
# on every `require`, and on every internal import, so it is public BY
# CONSTRUCTION in the repo it names — yet a diff that adds a NEW internal import
# (e.g. `"github.com/nfsarch33/llm-cluster-router/internal/crypto"`) tripped the
# handle pattern on a string the repo could not not contain. Measured
# 2026-08-31: llm-cluster-router PR #73 failed exactly this way, and so would
# every future PR to either public repo that adds an internal import.
#
# So the one string that is public by construction — this repo's own
# `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` slug, and ONLY that exact slug at a path boundary
# — is removed from the added lines before any pattern is matched. The slug
# comes from REPO_SLUG, the same origin-derived identity the internal-repo
# exemption above already trusts to skip EVERY pattern, so this grants strictly
# less than that decision does. It is deliberately the smallest narrowing that
# fixes the defect (docs/security/anti-leak.md, "Responding to a finding"):
#
#   * ONE token: the literal `github.com/<REPO_SLUG>`, anchored on the right to
#     a path boundary (`/ " ' backtick whitespace` or end-of-line) so a
#     DIFFERENT repo whose name merely shares this one's prefix is untouched.
#   * A reference to any OTHER repo under the same handle — a PRIVATE repo such
#     as `github.com/nfsarch33/cursor-global-kb`, or the bare handle in a
#     comment or config — carries a different slug (or none), is NOT removed,
#     and still trips the handle pattern. That is the genuine-leak case, pinned
#     in tools/deny-pattern-tests.sh next to this one.
#   * Nothing but this exact public slug is removed. On its own that is NOT
#     enough to make the removal safe — see the v18811 note directly below,
#     which is what makes it safe.
#
# With no github.com origin REPO_SLUG is empty, there is nothing public by
# construction to neutralize, and the diff is scanned unchanged.
#
# v18811 — the seventh, and the only one this file inflicted on itself: v18797
# above introduced a FALSE NEGATIVE, the class this gate exists to prevent.
#
# v18797 removed the own slug from every added line and then matched EVERY
# pattern against the shortened text. Removing text cannot create a match, but
# it can DESTROY one: any pattern whose match had to extend past the slug went
# silent while the payload stayed in the tree verbatim. Reproduced 2026-09-03
# against the merged scanner, in BOTH public repos, using the PUBLIC set only,
# so it needed no secret and no estate identifier:
#
#   +authorized_key: ssh-rsa AAAA<key> runner@github.com/<owner>/<this-repo>
#
# Both SSH-key patterns end `[^@]+@[^@]+`. That trailing `[^@]+` was satisfied
# by the module path and by nothing else on the line, so deleting the path took
# the match with it: exit 0, "OK: no deny-pattern matches". The identical line
# ending `runner@buildhost` exits 1. The Slack-token pattern fails the same way
# (`xoxb-` immediately followed by the module path at end of line).
#
# Two changes. The first is the one that matters:
#
#   1. NEUTRALIZE PER PATTERN, NOT GLOBALLY. A pattern reads the neutralized
#      copy only if the module path is a string that pattern would itself
#      match; every other pattern reads the added lines EXACTLY as written. The
#      false positive v18797 existed to fix is by definition such a pattern —
#      the operator handle IS the owner segment — so none of that fix is lost,
#      while a credential format, an address range or a vendor token, none of
#      which match a module path, can no longer be silenced by the removal.
#      What remains suppressible is only what the public-by-construction string
#      trips on its own, which is exactly the case this was written for.
#
#   2. THE REMOVAL LEAVES A SEPARATOR. Both rules now replace the slug with a
#      single space rather than one of them deleting it outright, so a removal
#      can neither splice its neighbours together nor truncate a line to end
#      one character short of a pattern. This is defence in depth behind (1),
#      never a substitute for it: a space satisfies `[^@]+` but not
#      `[0-9a-zA-Z-]+`, so a separator alone would have fixed the SSH case and
#      left the Slack one open.
#
#   3. AN ENTRY CARRYING AN ALTERNATION IS NEVER NEUTRALIZED. An ERE is not one
#      matcher: a top-level `|` makes it several independent ones, and gating
#      the whole ENTRY on the fact that ONE branch matches the module path puts
#      every OTHER branch on the shortened text — the same defect, reappearing
#      inside a single entry. Measured 2026-09-04 on this scanner with the two
#      regexes `<handle>` and `<token-format>`: as two entries the payload
#      exits 1, combined into one entry it exits 0. Deciding which `|` is
#      top-level needs a regex parser, so the test is the dumber and strictly
#      safer one — ANY `|` in the pattern disqualifies the entry, which can
#      only ever neutralize LESS, never more. The cost is a false positive if
#      someone writes the handle as one branch of an alternation; that is the
#      cheap direction, and pattern_reads_neutralized() below says so.
#
#   4. THE REMOVAL IS CASE-INSENSITIVE, like the matcher. Patterns are matched
#      with `grep -iE`, so an entry can be gated ON by a case-insensitive match
#      and then have the removal miss, because a host name is written
#      `GitHub.com` in prose and a clone URL need not carry the canonical case.
#      Both `s###` commands take the `I` flag (GNU sed; the runners are
#      `[self-hosted, linux]`). This is not a widening in the false-negative
#      direction: only a pattern that itself matches the module path ever reads
#      the neutralized copy, and that pattern is matched case-insensitively
#      anyway, so the removal now agrees with the matcher instead of quietly
#      disagreeing with it.

# slugs and in both directions.
